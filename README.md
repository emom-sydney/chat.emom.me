# A chat/notification server for sydney.emom 
## (that could potentially be opened up to *.emom)

In which we attempt to deploy a non-federated instance of a Matrix server, using a fork(?) of Conduit (itself a fork of Synapse?) called Continuwuity and I'm tired already but it's a worthy project (Continuwuity I mean) and not only would it be useful for the EMOM community to have a chat server, the possibility of using the platform to build out some of our planned automations (notifications, performer registrations, etc) makes it worth checking out.
